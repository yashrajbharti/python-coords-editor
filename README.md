# find-word-modify-line
This python code helps in advanced find and replace scenarios. Here the user wants to modify the whole sentence containing the word and not just replace the word itself. In my case I needed to find the word "-17." and grab the coordinates from that line and then edit the line placing it inside the LatLng() parameter.

## To run  
`python3 findandreplace.py`
